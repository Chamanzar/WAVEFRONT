## Notes

The WAVEFRONT Pipeline contains 6 Preprocessing scripts and 1 Detection Algorithm script. 

This code was written using eeglab version 2020.0 and is dependent on functions from this package; using eeglab of matching version is highly encouraged. 

## File Structure 
Users are free to use their own file organization strategies. However, the code assumes that the files are stored in the following format:

- *Folder of Patient IDs*
   - Sub-ID A
     - Sub-ID A
	    - *All files for Sub-ID A*
   - Sub-ID B
   - Sub-ID C

## Brief Description of Functions for Each Script, in Sequential Order
### StepMII 
- Load raw files (EEG, ECoG, Impedance, ECG, PLETH, and RESP data; as well as Annotation and CSD events) and combines into streamlined set of files
- Bandpass filter EEG and ECoG data between [0.1 - 50] Hz 
- Process ECG, PLETH and RESP data

### StepMI
- Lowpass EEG data [0 - 30] Hz 
- Resample EEG data from 256 Hz to 64 Hz

### StepZero
- Number CSD Events
- Combine EEG and ECoG data into single file 

### StepI
- Extract Delta Band of EEG and ECoG signal [0.5 - 4] Hz
- Normalize and remove outliers from ECoG signal

### StepII
- Normalize and remove outliers from EEG signal

### StepIII
- Filter events 
- Mask temporally isolated portions of EEG data
- Extract Power Envelope of EEG data
- Cross-correlate Power Envelope with First-Derivative Kernel

### Detection Algorithm 
- Load Processed Data from Preprocessing Pipeline 
- Project data into 2D space using electrode locations and spatial conversions
- Smooth projections and create binary images representing relevant data patterns
- Calculate Optical Flows from binary images 
- Score Flows based on speed and orientation
- At temporal frames with sufficient Optical Flow scores, detect Spreading Depolarization
- Compare detection results with ground truths for each Data Session and Threshold Combination
